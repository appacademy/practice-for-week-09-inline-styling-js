# Practice: Inline Styling in JavaScript

In this practice, you will be given an HTML file a list of rainbow colors on the
page. These color names should visually reflect the color as well.

## Set up

Clone the starter from the **Download** link at the bottom of this page.

## Instructions

Open __index.html__ in your browser. Remember to refresh whenever you make
changes.

Your job will be to fill in the code in the given script file
__inline-styling.js__ so that the  background color of each area matches the
color name. Open __inline-styling.js__ in VS Code, and complete the code as
indicated in the comments.

Some code will be written for you, so all you'll need to do is fill in code
where indicated. This work has been broken into a few short steps that require
only 1 or a few lines of code each.
